Ted Serbinski is the Vice President at Detroit Venture Partners, where he leads investments in early stage technology companies. Recently, he relocated from San Francisco to Metropolitan Detroit with his newlywed wife to help form and found a blossoming startup ecosystem through his roles as seed-stage investor, adviser, and interim-CTO. Additionally, he sits on the boards of Are You a Human, Detroit Labs, Marxent Labs, Sociocast, UpTo, and TechTown and is an advisor to Frankel Commercialization Fund at University of Michigan. 

Before coming to the Midwest, he founded Stanson Ventures, a successful micro fund, with a current ROI of 2.2x. Top investments include GraphScience, which recently closed a $2M round led by Raptor VC, and CrowdMob, which closed an undisclosed round including Andreessen Horowitz and Eduardo Saverin. Ted is also an adviser to GraphScience and is adviser/interim-CTO to MomTrusted and RentMethod. 

Prior to his investment career, Ted was a serial entrepreneur, most recently as co-founder and CTO of ParentsClick, which was acquired by Lifetime Television in 2008. He also was the founding engineer at Lullabot, where he architected numerous websites for a variety of Fortune 500 companies, including Sony, MTV, and Lifetime. For six years, Ted was a top developer and early contributing pioneer to the Drupal framework. He contributed more than 1,000 code patches and drove the framework through its most fundamental releases before mainstream adoption (Drupal is currently powering over 2% of all websites). Ted earned a Bachelor&rsquo;s of Science in Computer Engineering from Cornell University.
