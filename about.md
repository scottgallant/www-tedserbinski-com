<h3>The Extended Bio</h3>
<h4>Investor</h4>

Ted Serbinski is the Vice President at [Detroit Venture Partners](http://detroitventurepartners.com), where he leads investments in early stage software companies. Recently, he relocated from San Francisco to Metropolitan Detroit with his newlywed wife to help form and found a blossoming startup ecosystem through his roles as seed-stage investor and mentor.

Currently, he sits on the boards of Are You a Human, Detroit Labs, Marxent Labs, Sociocast, UpTo, Chalkfly, and TechTown and is an advisor to the Brandery and the Frankel Commercialization Fund at University of Michigan.

Top startups include GraphScience, [CrowdMob](http://crowdmob.com), [MomTrusted](http://momtrusted.com) and [RentMethod](http://rentmethod.com).

<h4>Founder</h4>

Prior to his investment career, Ted was a serial entrepreneur, most recently as co-founder and CTO of [ParentsClick](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/parentsclick-network), which was [acquired by Lifetime Entertainment in 2008](http://paidcontent.org/2008/08/27/419-lifetime-networks-acquires-parentsclick-network-first-digital-acquisiti/). ParentsClick was the 4th largest social network for parenting and mom bloggers in the country at the time of acquisition. Ted joined Lifetime as Directory of Technology and stayed on in this role during [Lifetime's merger with A&E Television in 2010](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/business/media/28lifetime.html?_r=0). While at Lifetime/A&E, he extended the community platform he architected for ParentsClick to host 8 Lifetime TV websites, serving a majority of Lifetime's total traffic of 3.5MM monthly uniques and 90MM monthly pageviews.

Before ParentsClick, Ted was the founding engineer of [Lullabot](http://lullabot.com), one of the world's leading Drupal web strategy, development, and training companies.

He contributed more than [1,000 code patches](https://www.google.com/search?q=drupal+m3avrck) and drove the framework through its most fundamental releases before mainstream adoption. Drupal is currently powering over 2% of all websites on the internet.
