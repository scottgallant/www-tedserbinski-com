Well Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

This morning before all the turkey and football I've managed to <a href="http://drupal.org/project/simplemenu">release version 4.0 of SimpleMenu</a>! 

This new release includes an upgrade to <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/">SuperFish 1.3</a> (note: 1.3.1+ won't work since it requies jQuery 1.2 and Drupal 5 only ships with jQuery 1.0), and a complete rewrite of the CSS, fixing a number of issues.

Additionally, you can now choose which theme you want to use to render the menu and/or specify your own. The first new theme is black & blue and is based on <a href="http://nerdliness.com/article/2007/11/01/simplemenu-module-customizations">Jeremy Caldwell's design</a>.

Lots of other bugs were fixed too, so <a href="http://drupal.org/node/194548">check out the release notes for details</a>.

Ok time for some turkey, Happy Thanksgiving all!
