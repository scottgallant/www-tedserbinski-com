Yes, you read that right folks. I have indeed left <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a> and have embarked on a new journey :-)

Over the past year+, I've had a fantastic time working with everyone at Lullabot, watching and helping the company grow from its infancy to a solid and flourishing company that it is now today. Truly one of the best jobs I've ever had :-)

But now what? Well, it's time for me to follow <a href="http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/research/entrepreneurship/index.html">my true passion</a>, dusting off a few books by my old <a href="http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty/profiles/BenDaniel/">professor</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smartups-Lessons-Entrepreneur-America-Start-Ups/dp/0801488311">reading a few new ones</a>, and <a href="http://cen.cornell.edu/">traveling a bit more</a> [yes, Cornell is my alma mater].

Of course I'll be blogging more soon about what I'm working on, and no, I'm not leaving the Drupal community just yet :-)
