Today, I am proud to announce that <a href="http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2008/2/prweb674954.htm">MothersClick has acquired the domain MothersGroups.com</a>. This strategic acquisition allows us to improve our online presence for helping moms to find local groups and activities.

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://mothersgroups.com/">MothersGroups.com</a> is a perfect example of a unique keyword domain that leverages the power of direct search while simultaneously driving increased SEO results within a highly targeted customer demographic</p>
<small>Pete Lamson, SVP & GM of <a href="http://www.namemedia.com/">NameMedia's marketplace properties</a></small>
</blockquote>

The domain <a href="http://mothersgroups.com/">MothersGroups.com</a> is our first direct search, SEO optimized, parenting portal and we plan to launch many more sites this year as we build out our network, pulling from over 150 parenting-related domains in our portfolio.
