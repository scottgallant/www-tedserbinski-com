<a href="http://www.mothersclick.com/">MothersClick</a> placed 1st in the Niche Social Networking category for <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/web2.0">SEOmoz's 3rd Annual Web 2.0 Awards</a>. I'm very pleased with the result as myself and the rest of the MothersClick team have really been working our tails off launching version 3 of our platform just a few months ago. Expect a more detailed look at this new version (including information about our brand new community API for Drupal to be released late summer/fall) in a future blog post.

Congratulations to other Drupal winners on this list including <a href="http://www.imbee.com/">imbee</a> who placed 3rd in the niche social networking category, <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/">NowPublic</a> who placed 2nd in social news, and to our friends at <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> who placed 3rd in WebDev.
