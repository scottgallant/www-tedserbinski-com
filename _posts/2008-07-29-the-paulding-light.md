<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tedserbinski/2713024192/" title="The Paulding Light by m3avrck, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3097/2713024192_d0858b264d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="The Paulding Light" align="left" /></a> Last week we were in upstate Michigan and went to see the Paulding Light just outside of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=watersmeet,+mi&ie=UTF8&z=10&iwloc=addr">Watersmeet, MI</a>.  This is a mysterious phenomenon of blinking lights, that almost looks like a mini star.

You can <a href="http://www.backwoodswisconsin.com/paulding_light.htm">read more about the Paulding Light here</a> and also find directions and other theories that try to explain where this light comes from.

When we saw it, there was a pathway that followed the power lines that looked like you could walk closer to the light. We walked a bit but the light never appeared larger. Some other folks there that night walked considerably closer and they said they never saw the light at all--despite us saying we saw it a few times as they walked! So it <strong>disappears</strong> as you get closer, crazy! 

Below is a short movie I made putting together clips from our cameras that we had. Can't wait to go back next year with some more equipment to explore!
