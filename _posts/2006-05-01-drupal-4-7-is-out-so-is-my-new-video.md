So <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-4.7.0">Drupal 4.7 is finally out</a>! It's been almost a year, but it's certainly been worth it. Look at all of the cool new features! It's a really great feeling having contributed many hours to this release myself, including one whole new feature of my own: MySQLi support!

Not only that, but I've created my first full feature video tutorial on installing Drupal 4.7. Here's the <a href="http://drupal.org/videocasts/installing-4.7">main Drupal.org link</a> and <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/videocast/installing-drupal-4.7">here it is on Lullabot.com</a>.

Check out what people are saying about my video and <a href="http://drupal.org/videocasts/upgrading-to-4.7">Matt's</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/videocasts/whats-new-in-4.7">Jeff's </a> on <a href="http://drupal.org/node/61334">Drupal.org</a> and <a href="http://digg.com/software/Two_videocasts_about_the_new_Drupal">Digg</a>.

Boy, was creating this movie harder than I thought! For an ~8min movie, it took just about ~8hrs to create and edit it and I was on a Mac! Whew, but it certainly was worth it, as it came out so professional looking, I might add ;-)

Stay tuned, there'll be many more videos coming down the pipe.

Current reviews I've been receiving:

<blockquote>
If you have an account, please digg it for more exposure. The videocasts are /really/ classy. Ted and Jeff have done an awesome job.
