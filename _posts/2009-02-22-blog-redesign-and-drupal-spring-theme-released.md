Almost exactly <a href="http://tedserbinski.com/tags/portfolio/ted-30-a-drupal-blog-redesign">1 year ago I redesigned this blog</a> and today, I unveil yet another new design. This time, it's running Drupal 6 and all that goodness. I've enhanced the contrast on the design quite a bit and really improved the readability on posts and comments, along with using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/geshifilter">GeSHi code filter</a> for much better display of code snippets. This theme was built on top of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blueprint">Drupal Blueprint theme</a>, which I maintain, and also made theming this site quick and simple.

As always, my previous theme (screen shot above) is now available for download below.  A <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tedserbinski/3299841846/sizes/o/">full page screenshot is also available</a> as well. Feel free to use the theme as example, turn into something better, and even contribute back to Drupal if you wish. I do not have any plans for it except to share with others. Please note, the theme is Drupal 5 so would need a tiny bit of work to make it work on Drupal 6.
