<a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> is a great new service that:

<blockquote>
[...] helps you navigate the Internet in a safer, faster, smarter and more reliable way. The service is free and requires nothing to download. OpenDNS doesn't replace your existing Internet connection, it just makes it better.
</blockquote>

It can prevent phising attacks, fix common URL typos, and speeds up DNS lookups (e.g., finding the IP address for http://www.google.com).

OpenDNS is very easy to setup and has great step-by-step directions for all routers, highly recommended!
