In <a href="http://twit.tv/itn25">episode 25 of Inside the Net</a>, hosts <a href="http://www.leoville.com/">Leo Laporte</a> and <a href="http://ambermac.com/">Amber MacArthur</a> talk with my co-worker <a href="http://www.jjeff.com/">Jeff Robins</a> about <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>. Jeff explains why we're using it as the choice CMS for many of our clients, including the redesign of the <a href="http://twit.tv">TWiT.tv</a> site and the new <a href="http://www.mtv.co.uk">MTV UK</a> site.

Not only that, but towards the end Leo speaks highly of <a href="http://lullabot.com">our work</a>, how stable Drupal is, and how <em>I'm</em> doing such as kick @$$ job. Rock! Listen to that clip below or check out the <a href="http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3?http://aolradio.podcast.aol.com/insidethenet/ITN-025.mp3">full episode</a>. Thanks Leo for the kind words!
