Last week when I was in NYC for <a href="http://www.mothersclick.com/">MothersClick</a> meetings, I met for an interview with <a href="http://sirkitree.net/">Jerad Bitner</a> and <a href="http://www.thethisorthat.com/">Dave Burns</a>, both developers at <a href="http://myplay.com/">SonyBMG</a>. These guys run a site called <a href="http://drupalmao.com/">DrupaLMAO</a>, a <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/">Diggnation</a> inspired site that posts weekly videos talking about the <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal community</a>.

<a href="http://drupalmao.com/ted-serbinski-interview">In the interview</a> I talk about how I got into Drupal and what projects I'm currently working on. I discuss how <a href="http://www.mothersclick.com/">MothersClick</a> is a blossoming startup project and how sister site, <a href="http://www.momblognetwork.com/">Mom Blog Network</a>, a Digg-esque site for moms, works. Both of these projects have spun off great contributions to the Drupal community including the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/simplefeed">SimpleFeed module</a> and my forthcoming <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blueprint">Blueprint theme</a>, do within a week. We wrap up the interview talking about my hobby project, <a href="http://2guysuncorked.com/">2 Guys Uncorked</a> and how we're changing the idea of wine and making it fun and easy, with huge results :)
