A few weeks back, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Laporte">Leo Laporte</a> approached <a href="http://www.lullabot.com">Lullabot</a> about developing the new <a href="http://www.twit.tv">TWiT website</a>. Well we gladly accepted, I mean, this is Leo! So I was put in charge of developing the new site, and deviating a bit from our usual consultant based contracts, we took the entire development for this project in house so I could really work my magic :-) Well I have to say, this site is coming out amazingly well and just a few days ago we gave Leo a sneak peak.

What we didn't realize was that he was going to plug us like crazy on <a href="https://www.twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/47?autostart=false">episode 47 of TWiT</a> (circa minute 53). His podcast is listened to by at least 250,000 people a week and is consistently in the top 10 podcasts on iTunes. A clip of what he said about us and especially, about my work, can be listened to below. Wow, thanks Leo! I do have to agree with him, this is some of my best work to date, a culmination of 7+ years of web design experience. ;-)

I'll have more details on the new site soon, along with a URL when we can officially announce it. So stay tuned!
