On the long plane ride home from London today (I was out there building the new MTV.co.uk site that is going live early August 2006, see some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tedserbinski/tags/london/">pictures</a>), I decided to completely rewrite the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/scheduler">scheduler module</a>. I based the rewrite upon an earlier <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/articles/how_to_create_a_publish_on_option_for_nodes">article I wrote about the TWiT.tv site</a> where I was using a simple publishing nodes technique. 

I talked with <a href="http://drupal.org/services/gerhard">Gerhard Killesreiter</a> who maintains the Drupal CVS repository and he said the scheduler module was mostly abandoned and needed some love. So I stepped up to the plate, <a href="http://drupal.org/cvs?commit=36780">took a big swing</a>, and got the module back in working shape. Not only that, but I cleaned up the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/scheduler">issue queue</a> too. Not too shabby for 2 hours of sleep and switching back 5 hours from one timezone to another in the same day :-)
