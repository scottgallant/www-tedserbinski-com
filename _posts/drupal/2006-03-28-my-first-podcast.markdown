Yes, it's true, I'm appearing regularly now on a weekly podcast about <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, wahoo! <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/drupal_podcast_no_7">My first appearance on a podcast</a> was a quick intro about me joining the <a href="http://www.lullabot.com">Lullabot team</a> and a quick update on the status of Drupal 4.7. And then <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/node/64">my first full length episode</a> was recorded just last week, so cool! 

I thought hearing my voice playback through the show would be a bit weird, but on the contrary, it sounded awesome! Gotta admit, putting out this weekly podcast with <a href="http://www.asitis.org/">Matt</a> and <a href="http://www.jjeff.com/">Jeff</a> is certainly a lot of fun and something a bit different!

If you have iTunes, you can <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=117672529&s=143441">subscribe to our podcasts</a>, otherwise check out <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/podcast">Lullabot.com</a>. Happy listening (to me that is, hah!).
