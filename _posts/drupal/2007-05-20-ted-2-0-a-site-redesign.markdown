Well it's been almost a year since this site has had an overhaul. The previous design, "Orange Mint" was a 4.7 beta site and held up well over the past year, despite it being very out of date.

With all the changes going on in my life (forthcoming blog posts to explain more) I decided to redesign this site and upgrade it to Drupal 5.

This new design I call "Black & Blue" and reflects a more mature me, overcoming various "bumps and bruises" over the past year :-)

And what of the old design? Well fear not, I plan to release the theme---many people have asked how parts of worked so I'll be making available a zip file of the theme shortly.

Till then, please let me know if you encounter any bugs. I will admit I was just too busy this weekend to thoroughly test it out :-)
