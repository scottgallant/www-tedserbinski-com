I've finally scheduled the next <a href="http://drupal.org/node/72498">Drupal meetup for July 26th at 7pm</a>! Due to everyone's busy schedules (mine included), we missed out on June, so to make up for this, <a href="http://developmentseed.org">Development Seed</a> is buying the first round of Coronas at <a href="http://www.busboysandpoets.com/">Bus Boys and Poets</a> :-D <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=2021+14th+st,+20009&ie=UTF8&ll=38.921289,-77.031841&spn=0.025776,0.090294&om=1">Directions here</a>, post a comment if you want to chat with me specifically about anything, I'm sure it's going to be a packed meetup!
