As I was wrapping up the new <a href="http://www.twit.tv">TWiT</a> site today, I needed to implement one new feature: scheduled publishing. I thought about it a bit and came up with a <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/node/85">very elegant solution</a>. Simple, lightweight, and unobtrusive in design, only accomplishable because of the new <a href="http://drupal.org/node/37775">forms API</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">CCK</a>.

And this is only the beginning, forms API 2.0 still needs to hit and CCK is getting better each and everyday. Imagine the possibilities later this year when Drupal 5.0 (or is that 4.8?) ships...
