When I redesign my blog, I like to release the previous theme out into the open for anyone to make use of. I did this last year with the <a href="http://tedserbinski.com/2007/06/22/orange-mint-drupal-theme-download">Orange Mint theme release</a> and it worked out well.

Attached below is a zip file of my "Black & Blue" Drupal theme. The code is licensed under the GPL so you are free to do with it as you wish. I just ask that you link back to my blog if you make use of it :)

So why not commit this to Drupal as a theme project? Well I have no intentions to maintain it, no desire to extract into a more generic and usable theme, and I have to catch plane to San Francisco in a few. But, if you want to make and extract this into a Drupal project, by all means please do. Enjoy!
