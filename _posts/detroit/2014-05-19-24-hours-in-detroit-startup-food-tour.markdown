I get a lot of inquiries from terrific startup folks around the country. Many mention they will be in Detroit for the day and want to get a good sense of the startup ecosystem. They want to see what [Detroit's entrepreneurial gold rush](/detroit/the-entrepreneurial-gold-rush-why-i-moved-from-san-francisco-to-detroit/) is all about. To help them, I started sharing a quick guide to Detroit by email and it’s grown over time.

Now, I'm expanding this email into a dedicated blog post for all to enjoy and contribute to. If there are any hot startup locations or must-eat restaurants missing from this list, please leave a comment so I can add them.

So where should a visitor to Detroit go in 24 hours to see our quickly growing startup ecosystem? And what should they eat while they are here?

Here’s what I recommend.
