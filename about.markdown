<h3>The Extended Bio</h3>
<h4>Investor</h4>

Ted Serbinski is the <span class="hl">Vice President at [Detroit Venture Partners](http://detroitventurepartners.com)</span>, where he leads investments in early stage software companies. Recently, he relocated from San Francisco to Metropolitan Detroit with his newlywed wife to help form and found a blossoming startup ecosystem through his roles as seed-stage investor and mentor.

Currently, he <span class="hl">sits on the boards</span> of Are You a Human, Detroit Labs, Marxent Labs, Sociocast, UpTo, Chalkfly, and TechTown and is an advisor to the [Brandery](http://brandery.org/) and the Frankel Commercialization Fund at University of Michigan.

Before coming to the Midwest, he founded [Stanson Ventures](http://stansonventures.com), a successful seed stage investment fund. Top startups include [GraphScience](http://www.graphscience.com), [CrowdMob](http://crowdmob.com), [MomTrusted](http://momtrusted.com) and [RentMethod](http://rentmethod.com).

<h4>Founder</h4>

Prior to his investment career, Ted was a serial entrepreneur, most recently as co-founder and CTO of [ParentsClick](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/parentsclick-network), which was [acquired by Lifetime Entertainment in 2008](http://paidcontent.org/2008/08/27/419-lifetime-networks-acquires-parentsclick-network-first-digital-acquisiti/). ParentsClick was the <span class="hl">4th largest social network for parenting and mom bloggers</span> in the country at the time of acquisition. Ted joined Lifetime as Director of Technology and stayed on in this role during [Lifetime's merger with A&E Television in 2010](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/business/media/28lifetime.html?_r=0). While at Lifetime/A&E, he extended the community platform he architected for ParentsClick to host 8 Lifetime TV websites, serving a majority of Lifetime's total traffic of 3.5MM monthly uniques and 90MM monthly pageviews.

Before ParentsClick, Ted was the first engineer and part of the founding team at [Lullabot](http://lullabot.com), one of the <span class="hl">world's leading Drupal web strategy, development, and training companies</span>. While there, Ted was the lead architect of numerous Fortune 500 websites, including Sony Music, MTV UK, Lifetime, the Seattle Times, [This Week in Tech](http://twit.tv/), and many more.

<h4>Hacker</h4>

Before joining [Lullabot](http://lullabot.com), Ted was a top developer and early contributing pioneer to the [Drupal](http://drupal.org) framework for more than eight years. He <span class="hl">contributed</span> more than [1,000 code patches](https://www.google.com/search?q=drupal+m3avrck) and drove the framework through its most fundamental releases before mainstream adoption. Today, Drupal powers more than two-percent of all websites online.

<h4>Student</h4>

An Ivy League trailblazer, Ted created his own degree at [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu) to better understand information technology and how it relates to entrepreneurship. He graduated with a <span class="hl">B.S. in Engineering</span>, with a declared major of Information Science, Systems & Technology and a minor in Computer & Electrical Engineering.

Ted is also a [3rd degree Knight of Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_of_Columbus) and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)">silver palmed Eagle Scout</a>.
